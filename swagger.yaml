  title: CoinMarketCap Cryptocurrency API Documentation
  version: 1.26.0
  description: "# Introduction\nThe CoinMarketCap API is a suite of high-performance
    RESTful JSON endpoints that are specifically designed to meet the mission-critical
    demands of application developers, data scientists, and enterprise business platforms.\n\nThis
    API reference includes all technical documentation developers need to integrate
    third-party applications and platforms. Additional answers to common questions
    can be found in the [CoinMarketCap API FAQ](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/faq).\n\n#
    Quick Start Guide\n\nFor developers eager to hit the ground running with the CoinMarketCap
    API here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API.\n\n1. **Sign
    up for a free Developer Portal account.** You can sign up at [pro.coinmarketcap.com](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com)
    - This is our live production environment with the latest market data. Select
    the free `Basic` plan if it meets your needs or upgrade to a paid tier.\n2. **Copy
    your API Key.** Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account
    dashboard. Copy your API from the `API Key` box in the top left panel.\n3. **Make
    a test call using your key.** You may use the code examples provided below to
    make a test call with your programming language of choice. This example [fetches
    all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD](https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest?start=1&limit=5000&convert=USD).
    \ \n  *Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own and use API
    domain `pro-api.coinmarketcap.com` or use the test API Key `b54bcf4d-1bca-4e8e-9a24-22ff2c3d462c`
    for `sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com` testing with our sandbox.coinmarketcap.com
    environment. Please note that our sandbox api has mock data and should not be
    used in your application.*"

        using the \"count\" parameter which defaults to 10 results.  \n- If \"time_end\"
        is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.   \n- If you don't need
        every \"time_period\" between your dates you may adjust the frequency that
        \"time_period\" is sampled using the \"interval\" parameter. For example with
        \"time_period\" set to \"daily\" you may set \"interval\" to \"2d\" to get
        the daily OHLCV for every other day. You could set \"interval\" to \"monthly\"
        to get the first daily OHLCV for each month, or set it to \"yearly\" to get
        the daily OHLCV value against the same date every year.  \n\n**Implementation
        Tips**\n- If querying for a specific OHLCV date your \"time_start\" should
        specify a timestamp of 1 interval prior as \"time_start\" is an exclusive
        time parameter (as opposed to \"time_end\" which is inclusive to the search).
        This means that when you pass a \"time_start\" results will be returned for
        the *next* complete \"time_period\". For example, if you are querying for
        a daily OHLCV datapoint for 2018-11-30 your \"time_start\" should be \"2018-11-29\".
        \  \n- If only specifying a \"count\" parameter to return latest OHLCV periods,
        your \"count\" should be 1 number higher than the number of results you expect
        to receive. \"Count\" defines the number of \"time_period\" intervals queried,
        *not* the number of results to return, and this includes the currently active
        time period which is incomplete when working backwards from current time.
        For example, if you want the last daily OHLCV value available simply pass
        \"count=2\" to skip the incomplete active time period.\n- This endpoint supports
        requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API
        response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.  \n  \n**Interval
        Options**  \n  \nThere are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used
        for \"time_period\" and \"interval\" parameters. For \"time_period\" these
        return aggregate OHLCV data from the beginning to end of each interval period.
        Apply these time intervals to \"interval\" to adjust how frequently \"time_period\"
        is sampled.  \n  \nThe first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
        \ \n**\"hourly\"** - Hour intervals in UTC.  \n**\"daily\"** - Calendar day
        intervals for each UTC day.  \n**\"weekly\"** - Calendar week intervals for
        each calendar week.  \n**\"monthly\"** - Calendar month intervals for each
        calendar month.    \n**\"yearly\"** - Calendar year intervals for each calendar
        year.  \n  \nThe second are relative time intervals.  \n**\"h\"**: Get the
        first quote available every \"h\" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported
        hour intervals are: \"1h\", \"2h\", \"3h\", \"4h\", \"6h\", \"12h\".  \n**\"d\"**:
        Time periods that repeat every \"d\" days (86400 second intervals). Supported
        day intervals are: \"1d\", \"2d\", \"3d\", \"7d\", \"14d\", \"15d\", \"30d\",
        \"60d\", \"90d\", \"365d\".  \n  \nPlease note that \"time_period\" currently
        supports the \"daily\" and \"hourly\" options. \"interval\" supports all interval
        options.  \n  \n**This endpoint is available on the following <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/api/features\"

        until the next interval period, it will be skipped.  \n\n**Implementation
        Tips**\n- Want to get the last quote of each UTC day? Don't use \"interval=daily\"
        as that returns the first quote. Instead use \"interval=24h\" to repeat a
        specific timestamp search every 24 hours and pass ex. \"time_start=2019-01-04T23:59:00.000Z\"
        to query for the last record of each UTC day.\n- This endpoint supports requesting
        multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will
        be wrapped in an additional object in this case.  \n  \n**Interval Options**
        \ \nThere are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for \"interval\".\n\nThe
        first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:  \n**\"hourly\"**
        - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.  \n**\"daily\"**
        - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.  \n**\"weekly\"**
        - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.  \n**\"monthly\"**
        - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.  \n**\"yearly\"**
        - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.  \n\nThe
        second are relative time intervals.  \n**\"m\"**: Get the first quote available
        every \"m\" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: \"5m\",
        \"10m\", \"15m\", \"30m\", \"45m\".  \n**\"h\"**: Get the first quote available
        every \"h\" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: \"1h\",
        \"2h\", \"3h\", \"4h\", \"6h\", \"12h\".  \n**\"d\"**: Get the first quote
        available every \"d\" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals
        are: \"1d\", \"2d\", \"3d\", \"7d\", \"14d\", \"15d\", \"30d\", \"60d\", \"90d\",
        \"365d\".  \n\n**This endpoint is available on the following <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/api/features\"

          Ethereum (ETH) is a smart contract platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (dapps) conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.

          Ethereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. On the blockchain, smart contracts allow for code to be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. The Ethereum network went live on July 30th, 2015 with 72 million Ethereum premined.
